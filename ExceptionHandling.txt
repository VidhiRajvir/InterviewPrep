The try-with-resources Statement
The try-with-resources statement is a try statement that declares one or more resources. A resource is an object that must be closed after the program is finished with it.
The try-with-resources statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement. Any object that implements java.lang.AutoCloseable, which includes all objects which implement java.io.Closeable, can be used as a resource.

static String readFirstLineFromFile(String path) throws IOException {
	    try (FileReader fr = new FileReader(path);
	         BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr)) {
	        return br.readLine();
	    }
	}
